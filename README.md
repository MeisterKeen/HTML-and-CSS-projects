# Projects

* [My Portfolio](meisterkeen.github.io)
* Space Station Site
* Movie Theater Site
* Miscellaneous practice pages

### Portfolio

This project was the culmination of my coursework -- a page that advertises my skills and shows what I know how to do.

### Space Station Site

This example page used some basic skills in CSS styling. It contains a navbar, image containers, a form and hover effects.

### Movie Theater Site

This page was my introduction to Bootstrap 4. I learned to use Bootstrap's native styling classes to quickly throw together a functional home page with all the basics.

### Miscellaneous Practice

In this repository you'll also find numerous practice pages -- some broken, others more complete and polished. These pages were the result of course challenges, or just personal experimentation to find out how various things worked.

I made sure to keep all my experimental fumblings on GitHub, as a way to remind myself of what I've learned and how I've gotten to where I am.
